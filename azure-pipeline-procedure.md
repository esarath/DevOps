>>> Here is a general step-by-step procedure for creating an Azure pipeline:
========================================================================

Go to the Azure DevOps portal and create a new project or open an existing one.

Navigate to the "Pipelines" section and select "New Pipeline."

Select the source control provider where your code is stored (e.g. GitHub, Azure Repos, etc.).

Select the repository and branch that contains the code you want to build and deploy.

Choose a template that best fits your needs, or select "Empty Job" to create a pipeline from scratch.

In the pipeline editor, you can add various tasks to the pipeline to define the steps for building, testing, and deploying your code. For example, you can add tasks for:

Compiling code (e.g. using Visual Studio Build)
Running unit tests (e.g. using MSTest)
Packaging the application (e.g. using Archive files)
Deploying the application to different environments (e.g. Azure App Service, AKS)
Once you've defined the tasks for your pipeline, you can save it and then run it to build and deploy your code.

After pipeline is run successfully, you can review the build and deploy logs to ensure that the pipeline completed successfully and troubleshoot any errors that may have occurred.

Once the pipeline is tested and validated, you can configure it to run automatically when new changes are pushed to the repository.

You can also monitor the pipeline and view the status of each build and deployment, including any errors that may have occurred.

Keep in mind that this is a general outline of the process and the specific tasks and settings will depend on the specific requirements of your project and the services you are using.
It's also important to note that the pipeline is not just limited to the build-test-deploy, you can add various other steps to the pipeline based on your requirements like Code Analysis, Security scanning and many more.
