> ***Here is a general step-by-step procedure for creating an Azure pipeline:
_____________________________________________________

Go to the Azure DevOps portal and create a new project or open an existing one.

Navigate to the "Pipelines" section and select "New Pipeline."

Select the source control provider where your code is stored (e.g. GitHub, Azure Repos, etc.).

Select the repository and branch that contains the code you want to build and deploy.

Choose a template that best fits your needs, or select "Empty Job" to create a pipeline from scratch.

In the pipeline editor, you can add various tasks to the pipeline to define the steps for building, testing, and deploying your code. For example, you can add tasks for:

Compiling code (e.g. using Visual Studio Build)
Running unit tests (e.g. using MSTest)
Packaging the application (e.g. using Archive files)
Deploying the application to different environments (e.g. Azure App Service, AKS)
Once you've defined the tasks for your pipeline, you can save it and then run it to build and deploy your code.

After pipeline is run successfully, you can review the build and deploy logs to ensure that the pipeline completed successfully and troubleshoot any errors that may have occurred.

Once the pipeline is tested and validated, you can configure it to run automatically when new changes are pushed to the repository.

You can also monitor the pipeline and view the status of each build and deployment, including any errors that may have occurred.

Keep in mind that this is a general outline of the process and the specific tasks and settings will depend on the specific requirements of your project and the services you are using.
It's also important to note that the pipeline is not just limited to the build-test-deploy, you can add various other steps to the pipeline based on your requirements like Code Analysis, Security scanning and many more.


>> An Azure pipeline architectural diagram typically includes several key components that work together to build, test, and deploy software:

Source Control: The source code for the software is stored in a source control repository, such as Azure Repos, GitHub, or GitLab. This allows developers to work on the code in parallel and collaborate on changes.

Build Agent: The build agent is responsible for building and compiling the code. It retrieves the code from the source control repository and uses tools such as Visual Studio Build or Gradle to build the code.

Test Agent: The test agent is responsible for running automated tests on the built code. It uses tools such as MSTest or JUnit to run the tests and ensure that the code is working as expected.

Artifacts Repository: The artifacts repository is where the built and tested code is stored. This can be an Azure Artifacts, a package management system such as NuGet, or a simple file share.

Deployment Agent: The deployment agent is responsible for deploying the built and tested code to the various environments, such as development, staging, and production. It uses tools such as Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Terraform to deploy the code.

Monitoring and Logging: Monitoring and logging of the system and application performance is a key aspect of devops to identify and troubleshoot issues quickly and effectively. Azure provides various services such as Azure Monitor, Azure Log Analytics and Azure Application Insights which can be used to monitor and log the system and application performance

Feedback and collaboration: Feedback and collaboration is an important aspect of DevOps, and tools such as Azure Boards and Azure Repos can be used to track work items, bugs, and code reviews, and communicate with the development team and stakeholders.

***This is a general overview and specific architecture can vary depending on the requirements, organization and technology stack. These components work together to automate the software development life cycle and allow teams to deliver software updates faster and with greater reliability.
